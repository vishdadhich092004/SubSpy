          "comment": "Great question! Since you're both beginners, I'd recommend focusing on simplicity first. The suggestions here are solid—CodeSandbox and StackBlitz are probably your best bets for web-based collaboration with live preview. They're designed specifically for this use case and require zero setup.\n\n\n\nIf you prefer a desktop editor, VS Code with Live Share is excellent, though you'll need to set up a local server for the preview (Live Server extension works well for basic HTML/CSS/JS).\n\n\n\nOne thing to consider: real-time collaboration can be tricky when you're learning because you might accidentally overwrite each other's work. I'd suggest establishing a simple workflow—maybe one person drives while the other observes and suggests, then swap roles. This actually helps learning more than both typing simultaneously.\n\n\n\nAlso, these tools handle different complexity levels. CodeSandbox shines for simple projects but can handle frameworks later. StackBlitz boots up faster and feels lighter. Try both and see which interface clicks for you.",

Mostly everything is configurable via environment variables itself but if the setup goes beyond merely using different environment variables these scripts can handle those things. I make them as a inline command chain before running either dev or prod environment, so the relevant scripts know to perform respective actions.\n\nI have also tried building a tool for scaffolding some of this, but i quickly realized that unless it is templatized, it does’t really add much value as setup varies wildly from project to project, and unless it is enforced as key part of development process. i.e constantly being documented and updated as things need to change with features being built especially in a team environment, it can actually leave blind spots.\n\nThen there is a config aspect to setups like containerized apps, where compose file if done well can actually orchestrate all of this. Few things it doesn’t do well, leave little incentive to build a tool and instead get moved to a bash script.\n\nI would be interested to see a tool that is agnostic to some of these nuances. A well designed setup can actually be helpful to remove the guesswork involved at the cost of some opinionated decisions by the tool. Maybe if there is a tool, more folks actually use it and come up with improvements and features.\n\nAll the best",

Since it's your computer, you're already trusted, it can't be insecure. But when you connect across  your wifi or local network, the browser doesn't know that, so it enables those security guarantees. The \"correct\" way to do this is to create a self signed development certificate and use that on your development computer's web server, and trust it from your mobile device. You'll need to do your own googling there, because those instructions will vary between programming language, server framework, and operating systems.\n\nYou could also install a proxy on the computer you're testing from, so that it looks like \"localhost\" to the testing computer but talks to your web server development machine.",
